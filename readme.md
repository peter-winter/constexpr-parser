# CTPG
## _C++ Compile Time Parser Generator_

C++ _**single header**_ library which takes a language description as a C++ code and turns it into a LR1 table parser with a deterministic finite automaton lexical analyzer, all in compile time.
What's more, the generated parser is actually itself capable of parsing in compile time.
All it needs is a C++17 compiler!

## Usage
Following code demonstrates a simple parser which takes a comma separated list of integer numbers as argument and prints a sum of them.

**`readme_example.cpp`**
```c++
#include "ctpg.hpp"
#include <iostream>
#include <charconv>

using namespace ctpg;
using namespace ctpg::buffers;

constexpr nterm<int> list("list");

constexpr char number_pattern[] = "[1-9][0-9]*";
constexpr regex_term<number_pattern> number("number");

int to_int(const std::string_view& sv)
{
    int i = 0;
    std::from_chars(sv.data(), sv.data() + sv.size(), i);
    return i;
}

constexpr parser p(
    list,
    terms(',', number),
    nterms(list),
    rules(
        list(number) 
            to_int,
        list(list, ',', number) 
            >= [](int sum, char, const auto& n){ return sum + to_int(n); }
    )
);

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    if (argc < 2)
        return -1;
    auto res = p.parse(string_buffer(argv[1]), std::cerr);
    bool success = res.has_value();
    if (success)
        std::cout << res.value() << std::endl;
    return success ? 0 : -1;
}
```

Compile and run:

```sh
g++ readme_example.cpp -std=c++17 -o example && example "10, 20, 30"
```

You should see the output : 60. If incorrect text supplied as an argument:

```sh
g++ readme_example.cpp -std=c++17 -o example && example "1, 2, 3x"
```
you should see:
```
[1:8] PARSE: Unexpected character: x
```

## Explanation

### Header
```c++
#include "ctpg.hpp"
```

### Namespaces

Namespace ctpg is the top namespace. There are couple of feature namespaces like ```buffers```
```c++
using namespace ctpg;
using namespace ctpg::buffers;
```
### Terminal symbols

Terminal symbols (short: terms) are symbols used in grammar definition that are atomic blocks.
Examples of the terms from a C++ language are: identifier, '+' operator, various keywords etc.

To define a term use the one of ```char_term```, ```string_term``` and ```regex_term``` classes.

Here is the example of a regex_term with a common integer number regex pattern.

```c++
constexpr char number_pattern[] = "[1-9][0-9]*";
constexpr regex_term<number_pattern> number("number");
```
The constructor argument ```("number")``` indicates a debug name and can be omitted, however it is not advised.
Names are handy to diagnose problems with the grammar. If omitted, the name will be set to the pattern string.

>Note: the pattern needs to have a static linkage to be allowed as a template parameter. This is C++17 limitation, and CTPG does not support C++20 features yet.

**Other types of terms**

```char_term``` is used when we need to match things like a ```+``` or ```,``` operator.
```string_term``` is used when we need to match a whole string, like a language keyword.

### Nonterminal symbols

Nonterminal symbols (short: nonterms) are essentially all non atomic symbols in the grammar. 
In C++ language these are things like: expression, class definition, function declaration etc.

To define a nonterm use the ```nterm``` class.

```c++
constexpr nterm<int> list("list");  
```

The constructor argument ("list") is a debug name as well, like in the case of regex_term.
The difference is in nterms names are neccessary, because they serve as unique identifiers as well.
Therefore it is a requirement that nonterm names are unique.

Template parameter ```<int>``` in this case is a **value type**. More on this concept later.

### Parser definition

The ```parser``` class together with its template deduction guides allows to define parsers using 4 arguments:

* Grammar root - symbol which is a top level nonterm for a grammar.
* List of all terms 
* List of all nonterms
* List of rules

The ```parser``` object should be declared as ```constexpr```, which makes all the neccessary calculations of the LR(1) table parser done in compile time.


Let's break down the arguments.

```c++
constexpr parser p(
    list,
    terms(',', number),         
    nterms(list),  
```
**Grammar root.** 

When the root symbol gets matched the parse is successful.

**Term list.**

List of terms enclosed in a ```terms``` call.

> Note: we can see that there is one extra term, the ```,```.
This one is an implicit ```char_term```. The code implicitly converts the char to the ```char_term``` class.
Therefore ```char_terms``` (as well as ```string_terms```) are allowed not to be defined in advance. Their debug names are assigned to 
the them by default to a char (or a string) they represent.

**Nonterm list.**

List of terms enclosed in a ```nterms``` call.

**Rules**

List of rules enclosed in a ```rules``` call.
Each rule is in the form of:
```nonterm(symbols...) >= functor ```
The ```nonterm``` part is what's called a **left side** of the rule. The symbols are called the **right side**.

The right side can contain any number of ```nterm``` objects as well as terms (```regex_terms```, ```char_terms``` or ```string_terms```).
Terms can be in their implicit form, like ```,``` in the example. Implicit ```string_terms``` are in form of "strings".

```c++
    rules(
        list(number)
            >= to_int
        list(list, ',', number)
            >= [](int sum, char, const auto& n)
            { return sum + to_int(n); }
    )
```

The first rule ```list(number)``` indicates that the ```list``` nonterm can be parsed using a single ```number``` regex term.

The second rule uses what's know as a left recurrence. In other words, a ```list``` can be parsed as a ```list``` followed by a ```,``` and a ```number```.

**Functors**

The functors are any callables that can accept the exact number of arguments as there are symbols on the right side and return a value type of the left side.
Each nth argument needs to accept a value of a **value type** of the nth right side symbol.

So in the case of the first ```to_int``` functor, it is required to accept a value type of ```regex_term``` and return an ```int```.

The second functor is a lambda which accepts 3 arguments: an ```int``` for the ```list```, a ```char``` for the ```,``` and auto for whatever is passed as
a value type for the ```regex_term```.

>Note: Functors are called in a way that allows taking advantage of move semantics, so defining it's arguments as a move reference is encouraged.

**Value types for terms**

Terms unlike nonterms (which have their value types defined as a template parameter to the nterm definition),
have their value types predefined to either a ```term_value<char>``` for a ```char_term```, and a ```term_value<std::string_view>``` 
for both ```regex_term``` and ```string_term```.

The ```term_value``` class template is a simple wrapper that is implicitly convertible to it's template parameter (either a ```char``` or ```std::string_view```).
That's why when providing functors we can simply declare arguments as either a ```char``` or a ```std::string_view```.
Of course an ```auto``` in case of lambda will always do the trick.

The advantage of declaring functor arguments as ```term_value``` is that we can access other features (like source tracking) using the ```term_value``` methods.

### Parse method call

Use ```parse``` method with 2 argumets:
- a buffer
- an error stream

**Buffers**

Use a string_buffer from a ```buffers``` namespace to parse a null terminated string or a ```std::string```.

**Error stream**

Stream reference like ``std::cerr`` or any other ```std::ostream``` can be pased as a stream argument.
This is the place where the ```parse``` method is going to spit out error messages like a syntax error.

```c++
auto res = p.parse(string_buffer(argv[1]), std::cerr);
```

**Parse return value**

The ```parse``` method returns an ```std::optional<T>```, where ```T``` is a value type of the root symbol.
Use the ```.has_value()``` and the ```.value()``` to check and access the result of the parse.

>Note: White space characters are skipped by default between consequent terms.

## Compile time parsing

Example code can be easily changed to create an actual constexpr parser.
First, all the functors need to be constexpr. 
To achieve this change the ```to_int``` function to:

```c++
constexpr int to_int(const std::string_view& sv)
{
    int sum = 0;
    for (auto c : sv) { sum *= 10; sum += c - '0'; }
    return sum;
}
```

The function is now _constexpr_. The ```<charconv>``` header is now unneccessary.

>Note: To allow _constexpr_ parsing all of the nonterm value types have to be _literal types_.

Also change the _main_ to use ```cstring_buffer``` and declare a parse result _constexpr_.
The error stream argument is also unavailable in _constexpr_ parsing.

```c++
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    if (argc < 2)
    {
        constexpr char example_text[] = "1, 20, 3";
        
        constexpr auto cres = p.parse(cstring_buffer(example_text)); // notice cstring_buffer and no std::err output
        std::cout << cres.value() << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
        
    auto res = p.parse(string_buffer(argv[1]), std::cerr);
    bool success = res.has_value();
    if (success)
        std::cout << res.value() << std::endl;
    return success ? 0 : -1;
}
```

Now when no argument is passed to the program, it prints the compile time result of parsing "1, 20, 3". 

```sh
g++ readme_example.cpp -std=c++17 -o example && example
```
should print the number 24.

### Invalid input in _constexpr_ parsing
If the ```example_text``` variable was an invalid input, the code ```cres.value()```
would throw, because the ```cres``` is of type ```std::optional<int>``` with no value.


Changing the ```parse``` call to:
```
constexpr int cres = p.parse(cstring_buffer(example_text)).value();
```
would cause compilation error, because throwing ```std::bad_optional_access``` is not _constexpr_.

## LR(1) parser
   
CTPG uses a LR(1) parser. This is short from left-to-right and 1 lookahead symbol.

### Algorithm

The parser uses a parse table which is somewhat resebling a state machine. 
Here is pseudo code for the algorithm:

```
struct entry
   int next          // valid if shift
   int rule_length   // valid if reduce
   int nterm_nr      // valid if reduce   
   enum kind {success, shift, reduce, error }
   
bool parse(input, sr_table[states_count][terms_count], goto_table[states_count][nterms_count])
   state = 0
   states.push(state)
   needs_term = true;
   
   while (true)
      if (needs_term)
         term_nr = get_next_term(input)
      entry = sr_table[state, term_nr]
      kind = entry.kind
           
      if (kind == success)
         return true
         
      else if (kind == shift)
         needs_term = true;
         state = entry.next
         states.push(state)
         continue
         
      else if (kind == reduce)
         states.pop_n(entry.rule_length)
         state = states.top()
         state = goto_table[state, entry.nterm_nr]
         continue
         
      else
         return false
```

Parser contains a state stack, which grows when the algorithm encounters a _shift_ operation and shrinks on _reduce_ operation.

Aside from a state stack, there is also a value stack for dedicated for parse result calculation. 
Each _shift_ pushes a value to the stack and each _reduce_ calls an appropriate functor with values from a value stack, removing values from a stack and replacing them with a single value associated with a rule's left side.

**Table creation**

This topic is out of scope of this manual. There is plenty of material online on LR parsers. 
Recomended book on the topic: [Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools)

### Conflicts

There are situations (parser states) in which when a particualr term is encountered on the input, there is an ambiguity regarding the operation a parser should perform.

In other words a language grammar may be defined in such a way, that both _shift_ and _reduce_ can lead to a successfull parse result, however the result will be different in both cases.

**Example 1**

Consider a classic expression parser (functors omitted for clarity):

```
constexpr parser p(
    expr,
    terms('+', '*', number),
    nterms(expr),
    rules(
        expr(number),
        expr(expr, '+', expr),
        expr(expr, '*', expr)
    )
);
```

Consider ```2 + 2 * 2``` input being parsed and a parser in a state after successfully matching ```2 + 2``` and encountering ```*``` term.

Both _shifting_ a ```*``` term and _reducing_ by the rule expr(expr, '+', expr) would be valid, however would produce different results.
This is a classic operator **precedence** case, and this conflict needs to be resolved somehow. This is where precedence and associativity take place.

### Precedence and associativity

CTPG parsers can resolve such conflict based on precedence and associativity rules defined in a grammar.

Example above can be fixed by explicit term definitions.

Normally, ```char_terms``` can be introduced by implicit definition in the ```terms``` call. However when in need to define a precedence, explicit definition is required.

Simply change the code to:

``` c++
constexpr char_term o_plus('+', 1);  // precedence set to 1
constexpr char_term o_mul('*', 2);   // precedence set to 2

constexpr parser p(
    expr,
    terms(o_plus, o_mul, number),
    nterms(expr),
    rules(
        expr(number),
        expr(expr, '+', expr),      // note: no need for o_plus and o_mul in the rules, however possible
        expr(expr, '*', expr)
    )
);
```

The higher the precedence value set, the higher the term precedence. Default term precedence is equal to 0. 

This explicit precedence definition allows a ```*``` operator to have bigger precedence over ```+```.

**Example 2**

``` c++
constexpr char_term o_plus('+', 1);  // precedence set to 1
constexpr char_term o_minus('-', 1);  // precedence set to 1
constexpr char_term o_mul('*', 2);   // precedence set to 2

constexpr parser p(
    expr,
    terms(o_plus, o_minus, o_mul, number),
    nterms(expr),
    rules(
        expr(number),
        expr(expr, '+', expr),
        expr(expr, '-', expr),   // extra rule allowing binary -
        expr(expr, '*', expr),
        expr('-', expr)          // extra rule allowing unary -
    )
);
```

Binary ```-``` and ```+``` operators have the same precedence in pretty much all languages.
Unary ```-``` however almost always have a bigger precedence than all binary operators. 
We can't achieve this by simply defining ```-``` precedence in ```char_term``` definition.
We need a way to tell that ```expr('-', expr)``` has a bigger precedence then all binary rules.

To achieve this override the precedence in a term by a precedence in a rule changing:

```expr('-', expr)```
to
```expr('-', expr)[3]```

The ```[]``` operator allows exactly this. It explicitly sets the rule precedence so the parser does not have to deduce rule precedence from a term.

So the final code looks like this:

```c++
constexpr char_term o_plus('+', 1);  // precedence set to 1
constexpr char_term o_minus('-', 1);  // precedence set to 1
constexpr char_term o_mul('*', 2);   // precedence set to 2

constexpr parser p(
    expr,
    terms(o_plus, o_minus, o_mul, number),
    nterms(expr),
    rules(
        expr(number),
        expr(expr, '+', expr),
        expr(expr, '-', expr),   // extra rule allowing binary -
        expr(expr, '*', expr),
        expr('-', expr)[3]       // extra rule allowing unary -, with biggest precedence
    )
);
```

**Example 3**

Consider the final code and let's say the input is ```2 + 2 + 2```, parser has read ```2 + 2``` and is about to read the second ```+```.
In this case what is the required behaviour? Should the first ```2 + 2``` be reduced or a second ```+``` should be shifted?
(This may not matter in case of integer calculations, but may have a big difference in situations like expression type deduction in c++ when operator overloading is involved.)

This is the classic **associativity** case which can be solved by expicitly defining the term associativity. 

There are 3 types of associativity available: _left to right_, _right to left_ and _not associative_ as the default.

To explicitly define a term associativity change the term definitions to:

``` c++
constexpr char_term o_plus('+', 1, associativity::ltor);
constexpr char_term o_minus('-', 1, associativity::ltor);
constexpr char_term o_mul('*', 2, associativity::ltor);
```

Now all of these operators are left associative, meaning the _reduce_ will be preferred over _shift_.

Should the associativity be defined as ```associativity::rtol```, _shift_ would be preferred.

No associativity prefers shift by default.


**Precedence and associativity summary**

When a _shift_ _reduce_ conflict is encountered these rules apply in order:

Let **r** be a rule which is a subject to reduce and **t** be a term that is encountered on input.

1. when explicit **r** precedence  from ```[]``` operator is bigger than **t** precedence, perform a _reduce_
2. when precedence of **last term** in **r** is bigger than **t** precedence, perform a _reduce_
3. when precedence of **last term** in **r** is equal to **t** precedence and
   **last term** in **r** is left associative, perform a _reduce_
4. otherwise, perform a _shift_.

**Reduce - reduce conflicts**

In some cases the language is ill formed and the parser contains a state in which there is an ambiguity between several _reduce_ actions.

Consider example:

```c++
constexpr nterm<char> op("op");
constexpr nterm<char> special_op("op");

constexpr parser p(
    op,
    terms('!', '*', '+'),
    nterms(special_op, op),
    rules(
        special_op('!'),
        op('!'), 
        op('*'),
        op('+'),
        op(special_op)
    )
);
```

Let's say we parse an input ```!```. The parser has no way of telling if it should reduce using rule ```special_op('!')``` or ```op('!')```.

This is an example of reduce/reduce conflict and such parser behaviour should be considered _undefined_.

There is a diagnostic tool included in CTPG which detects such conflicts so they can be addressed.

## Functors - advanced

Consider a parser matching white space separated names (strings).

```c++

constexpr char pattern[] = "[a-zA-Z0-9_]+";
constexpr regex_term<pattern> name("name");
using name_type = std::string_view;
using list_type = std::vector<name_type>;
constexpr nterm<list_type> list("list");

constexpr parser p(
    list,
    terms(name),
    nterms(list),
    rules(
        list(),
        list(name, list)
    )
);
```

How exactly would the functors look for this kind of parser?

The first rule ```expr()``` is an example of an empty rule. This means the list can be _reduced_ from no input.

Since the rule's left side is a ```list``` the functor needs to return its **value type**, which is a ```list_type```.
The right side is empty so the functor needs to have no arguments.

So let's return an empty vector: ``` [](){ return list_type{}; } ```

The second rule reduces a list from a name and a list, therefore the functor needs to accept:
- ```term_value<std::string_view>``` for the first argument: name
- ```list_type``` for the second argument: list
- return a ```list_type```

So let's create a functor:

```[](auto&& name, auto&& list){ list.emplace_back(std::move(name)); return list; }```

The ```name``` argument will resolve to ```term_value<std::string_view>&&```, which is convertible to ```std::string_view&&```.

Now the parser looks like this:

```c++
constexpr char pattern[] = "[a-zA-Z0-9_]+";
constexpr regex_term<pattern> name("name");
using name_type = std::string_view;
using list_type = std::vector<name_type>;
constexpr nterm<list_type> list("list");

constexpr parser p(
    list,
    terms(name),
    nterms(list),
    rules(
        list() 
            >= [](){ return list_type{}; },
        list(name, list)
            >= [](auto&& name, auto&& list){ list.push_back(name); return std::move(list); }
    )
);
```

>Note: Here we take advantage of move semantics which are supported in the functor calls. This way we are working with the same ```std::vector``` instance
we created as empty using the first rule.

>**Important Note**
It is possible for functors to have referrence (both const and not) argument types, however lifetime of the objects passed to functors ends immediately after the functor returns.
So it is better to avoid using referrence types as nterm value types.

### Functor helpers

There are a couple of handy ready to use handler templates:

**val**

Use when a functor needs to return a value which doesn't depend on left side:

```c++
using namespace ctpg::ftors;
constexpr nterm<bool> binary("binary");

constexpr parser p(
    binary,
    terms('0', '1', '&', '|'),
    nterms(binary),
    rules(
        binary('0') 
            >= val(false),
        binary('1') 
            >= val(true),
        binary(binary, '&', binary) 
            >= [](bool b1, auto, bool b2){ return b1 & b2; },
        binary(binary, '|', binary) 
            >= [](bool b1, auto, bool b2){ return b1 | b2; },
    )
);   
```

**create**

Use when a functor needs to return a defalt value of a given type:

```c++

// word list parser from one of previous examples

using namespace ctpg::ftors;

constexpr parser p(
    list,
    terms(name),
    nterms(list),
    rules(
        list() 
            >= create<list_type>{},    // use instead of a lambda
        list(name, list)
            >= [](auto&& name, auto&& list){ list.push_back(name); return std::move(list); }
    )
);
```

**element placeholders**

Use whenever a rule simply passes nth element from the right side:

```c++

using namespace ctpg::ftors;

constexpr char pattern[] = "[1-9][0-9]*";
constexpr regex_term<pattern> number("number");

constexpr to_int(std::string_view x){ /*implement*/ }

constexpr nterm<int> expr("expr");

constexpr parser p(
    expr,
    terms('+', '(', ')', number),
    nterms(expr),
    rules(
        expr(number)
            >= to_int,
        expr(expr, '+', expr)
            >= [](int i1, auto, int i2){ return i1 + i2; },
        expr('(', expr, ')')
            >= _e2      // here, just return the second element
    )
);
```

## Default functors

There is a situation where the functor can be entirely omitted, that is whenever a left side value type is _move constructible_ from right side value types:

```c++
constexpr char word_pattern[] = "[0-9A-Za-z]+";
constexpr regex_term<word_pattern> word("word");
constexpr char protocol_pattern[] = "http://|https://";
constexpr regex_term<protocol_pattern> protocol("protocol");

using list_type = std::vector<std:string_view>;
struct url_type
{
    constexpr url_type(std::string_view pr, list_type&& l):
         pr(pr), l(std::move(l))
    {}
    std::string_view pr;
    list_type l;
};

constexpr nterm<url_type> url;
constexpr nterm<list_type> list;

constexpr parser p(
    url,
    terms(word, '.', protocol),
    nterms(url, list),
    rules(
        list(word)
            >= [](auto w){ return list_type{w}; },
        list(list, '.', word)
            >= [](auto&& l, auto, auto w){ l.push_back(w); return std::move(l); },
        url(protocol, list)
            // skip functor entirely, url_type move constructible from right side value types
    )
);
```
